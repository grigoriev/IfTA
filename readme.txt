Please create a new package "com.ifta.candidate.test.YOURNAME" and implement
the interfaces in the package "com.ifta.candidate.test.interfaces" to create 
a "DataFile" class that can read the binary file "data/test.bin". 

Use the interface methods to access the data and create one plot of the 
resulting data in the program of your choice, e.g. create a ASCII file
and plot in Excel, GNU plot, etc. 

Analyze the plot - there are several oddities - point them out.  Please 
save the image of the plot to your package directory. 

Run the ANT task "candidate-test-result-zip.xml" to create a ZIP file with
the results and send it back to IfTA.

Please also tell us how long it took you to solve this test - depending on 
your skills we expect a "guru" to solve this in 1 hours and an alumnus in up 
to 6 hours.
